                <h1>The future of education is here</h1>
                <p>The concept of traditional education has changed radically within the last couple of years. Being
                    physically present in a classroom isn’t the only learning option anymore — not with the rise of the
                    internet and new technologies, at least. Nowadays, you have access to a quality education whenever
                    and
                    wherever you want, as long as you have access to a computer. We are now entering a new era — the
                    revolution of online education.</p>

            <h1>It's flexible</h1>
            <p>Online education enables the teacher and the student to set their own learning pace, and there’s the
                added flexibility of setting a schedule that fits everyone’s agenda. As a result, using an online
                educational platform allows for a better balance of work and studies, so there’s no need to give
                anything up. Studying online teaches you vital time management skills, which makes finding a good
                work-study balance easier. Having a common agenda between the student and teacher can also prompt
                both parties to accept new responsibilities and have more autonomy. </p>

            <h1>It offers a wide selection of programs. </h1>
            <p>In a space as vast and wide as the internet, there are infinite skills and subjects to teach and learn. A
                growing number of universities and higher education schools are offering online versions of their
                programs for various levels and disciplines. From music composition to quantum physics, there are
                options for every type of student. Studying your program online is also a great option for getting an
                official certificate, diploma, or degree without physically setting foot on a university campus. </p>

            <h1>It’s accessible. </h1>
            <p>Online education enables you to study or teach from anywhere in the world. This means there’s no need to
                commute from one place to another, or follow a rigid schedule. On top of that, not only do you save
                time, but you also save money, which can be spent on other priorities. The virtual classroom is also
                available anywhere there’s an internet connection, and a good way to take advantage of this is to
                travel. For example, if you’re studying abroad and want to get a job, online education is a great
                choice. There’s no reason to give up on working or studying while exploring new and exotic places. </p>
